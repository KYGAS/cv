                      Given the nature of the live-action games, even slight delays in network traffic can cause disadvantage in competitions.
                      This projects aims to eliminate the ping tax on the player by analyzing the client trafic and emulating server responses at 0 network delay.

                  <ul class='vertical-list'>
                    <li>This application served as the main guard for our server and my best learning opportunity. Using a large amount of data and
                      analysis, alongside game datacenter rules I created an application that analyzed the network and
                      ensured the data sent by clients was within server settings. This tool included Real-Time admin
                      notification ( upon spotting a cheater ), cheat prevention and cheat detection.</li>
                    <li>This anti-cheat system was purely server sided and didn't cause any sort of user-privacy
                      concerns.</li>
                    <li>The usergroup of this project was me and my moderation team.</li>

                  <ul class='vertical-list'>
                    <li>Due to the nature of interpretted languages it's proven difficult to create modules while also prevent other users/developers to easily reverse them.
                        This creates an issue where players can easily read, modify and potentialy misuse certain modules. Using my current project I created a way for myself
                        to combine C/C++ and NodeJS to create compiled Node files that can be dynamically loaded by the modding community while retaining code security.
                    </li>
                    <li>The usergroup of this project is only me so far.</li>

                  <ul class='vertical-list'>
                    <li>Alongside the Anti-Cheat system this has been my favorite project to date. Using some predefined rules and a bunch of analyzed data,
                        as well as dynamically tracking AI's surroundings, a system was put in place which was supposed to allow players to quickly fill their parties
                        with "players" of average skill rating. Effectively minimizing wait times and allowing players to enjoy the content the way they like the most.
                        The AI system would simulat a massive amount of players, log in, roam the open world and upon request to join the party looking for members.
                        After that the AI would follow a standard procedure and follow the party members on their way to tackle the dungeon.
                    </li>
                    <li>Target group of this tool was players of our game that didn't have predefined parties or just wanted to chill alone.</li>

                    <li>One of my major projects during my game development was an introduction of "Tank Valkyrie". This
                      change contained brainstorming, implementation and testing of many sneaky aspects of the game and
                      research of the game's systems. Followed by analysis of the feedback and adjustement of the new features.</li>
                    <li>Most of the players of this class loved the option to change the to a Tank and get a new
                      experience.</li>
                    <li>This project isn't available online as it was a part of the entire game and therefore wasn't

                    <li>This project allowed the users to retain 100% of the actions that happened during their session.
                      It's intention was to later use a "Tera Replay" module to analyze of relive their game from a
                      different perspective.</li>
                    <li>Majority of the playerbase was interested in this module as it allowed them to save their

                    <li>The purpose of this module was to allow players with low-end computers to compete in the

                      removed/added them depending on the user's state.</li>

                    <li>This module was developed due to the high demand to see "Real-Time" defense values of enemies.
                        By tracking the game's traffic, necessary packets and game data and applying theorycrafted math, this module dynamically adjusted
                        the resistance of enemies therefore helping players to more easily adjust their builds and playstyles.</li>
                    <li>This module was requested by most of the TERA community, and was very well received..</li>
