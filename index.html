                  <h3>Anti-Cheat System v1</h3>
                  <ul class='vertical-list'>
                    <li>This application served as the main guard for our server. Using a large amount of data and
                      analysis, alongside game datacenter rules I created an application that analyzed the network and
                      ensured the data sent by clients was within server settings. This tool included Real-Time admin
                      notification ( upon spotting a cheater ), cheat prevention and cheat detection.</li>
                    <li>This anti-cheat system was purely server sided and didn't cause any sort of user-privacy
                      concerns.</li>
                    <li>The usergroup of this project was me and my team.</li>
                    <li>This project is close-sourced due to it's nature.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Class Job Change ( in-game )</h3>
                  <ul class='vertical-list'>
                    <li>One of my major projects during my game development was an introduction of "Tank Valkyrie". This
                      change contained brainstorming, implementation and testing of many sneaky aspects of the game and
                      research of the game's systems. </li>
                    <li>Most of the players of this class loved the option to change the to a Tank and get a new
                      experience.</li>
                    <li>This project isn't available online as it was a part of the entire game and therefore wasn't
                      made as a separate repository.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                  <h3>Tera Recorder</h3>
                  <ul class='vertical-list'>
                    <li>This project allowed the users to retain 100% of the actions that happened during their session.
                      It's intention was to later use a "Tera Replay" module to analyze of relive their game from a
                      different perspective.</li>
                    <li>Majority of the playerbase was interested in this module as it allowed them to save their
                      characters and later transfer them onto different servers.</li>
                    <li>This project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/KYGAS/Tera-Recorder">Github</a></li>

                  <ul class='vertical-list'>
                    <li>Using this application, user was able to quickly inspect the item in the datacenter of the
                      game.Game developers could now quickly and easily edit any of the data related to the item.</li>
                    <li>This tool was used by most of the staff in my team at the time.</li>
                    <li>This project is close-sourced with only it's binary being available to the public on <a
                        href="https://github.com/KYGAS/Item-Crafter">Github</a></li>

                  <ul class='vertical-list'>
                    <li>The purpose of this module was to allow players with low-end computers to compete in the
                      mass-scale PvP content. It dynamically determined which elements are not important to the user and
                      removed/added them depending on the user's state.</li>
                    <li>Target group of this tool was most of the playerbase due to the game's generally poor
                      performance.</li>
                    <li>This project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/KYGAS/PvP-Optimizer">Github</a></li>
